# hello_world_using_AWS-CDK_with_python
<br>
This project demonstrates how to create a simple Hello World Lambda function using AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) in Python. The Lambda function returns a simple "Hello, World!" message when invoked.
<br>

# Prerequisites
<br>
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.7+
* AWS CLI: To interact with AWS services.
* AWS CDK: To define cloud resources as code.
* Node.js (version 14 or higher): Required for AWS CDK.

# Features
This project implements a simple Hello World Lambda function using AWS CDK. Key features include:

* Serverless Architecture: The Lambda function runs in a serverless environment, meaning no infrastructure management is required from the user.
* Scalability: The Lambda function can scale automatically based on the incoming request load, allowing for efficient handling of varying workloads.
* Customizable: The code can be easily modified to expand the Lambda functionâ€™s capabilities, such as integrating with other AWS services, APIs, or databases.
* Quick Deployment: Using AWS CDK, the stack is defined as code and can be deployed with a few commands, automating the setup and management of resources.
* Simple Invocation: The Lambda function can be invoked manually from AWS Lambda console or AWS CLI, returning a simple "Hello, World!" message as a response.

# How It Works
The project works by following the steps below:

1. Setting Up the Environment: First, AWS CLI and AWS CDK are configured. The AWS CLI provides access to AWS services and credentials, while AWS CDK is used to define infrastructure using code.
2. Lambda Function Creation: A simple Python-based Lambda function is defined that returns a "Hello, World!" message when invoked. The function is packaged and deployed as part of the AWS CDK stack.
3. CDK Stack Definition: Using the AWS CDK, a stack is created that includes the Lambda function. The stack is defined in the hello_world_lambda_stack.py file, where resources like the Lambda function are specified along with their properties (runtime, handler, source code location).
4. Deployment: Once the stack is defined, the cdk deploy command is run. This synthesizes the stack into a CloudFormation template, which is then deployed to AWS, provisioning the Lambda function and other required resources.
5. Testing the Lambda: After deployment, the Lambda function can be tested from the AWS Lambda Console or using the AWS CLI. The function simply returns a status code of 200 and a message body of "Hello, World!" upon invocation.
6. Scalability and Flexibility: The function is event-driven and can handle multiple invocations concurrently without requiring manual scaling. It operates in a serverless environment, meaning that resources are automatically managed based on demand, and users only pay for execution time.

This entire process is automated, making it easy to deploy, test, and scale serverless applications without managing infrastructure.
